# About
A python script for Raspberry Pi that moves servo's angle with smoothly using cosine. 
That project does not serve a complete module, it just provides an algorithm to inspire. 


# The Idea
Controlling the servo's acceleration. 
Starting slowly, then fast, then stop slowly. 



# Installation
Just download the "servoSmoothMove.py" file and add it to your project.


# Key Variables
These are key variables and you can edit according to your needings;


    #servo's connected pin.
    servoPIN = 15
    
    #movement data.
    start_pos = 40
    end_pos = 160

# The Algorithm
The script uses the cosine function to provide smooth movement.
When printing the movement value to the console we get that result and servo's movement will be like that.
